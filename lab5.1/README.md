To use this code donwload lab5.1 file and execute the comand "make", this will create into the same "lab5.1" the .o files for every 
memory#.c . If you want to create one by one just tape "make memory#.c" and you will see an .o file created on the "lab5.1" file, but in this 
time just for the specified memory#.c 

have fun
