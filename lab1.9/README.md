LAB 1.9

To use this code make sure to modify the ROW_SIZE varibale and your MATRIX_TOTAL_SIZE acording to your matrix size. In this case I use two different 3x3 matrixes (testingMatrix.dat and testingMatrix2.dat) you can modify the file names to use another different matrixes.

MAKE SURE ALL FILES ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY!

to complie this code use the following comands:

  $ gcc -o multiplier.o multiplier.c -pthread
  &./multiplier.o
  
YOU WILL SEE THE RESULT.dat FILE ON THE SAME DIRECTORY !
