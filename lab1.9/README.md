LAB 1.9

To use this code make sure to modify the ROW_SIZE varibale and your TOTAL_MATRIX_SIZE acording to your matrix size. In this case I use two different 3x3 matrixes (testingMatrix.dat and testingMatrix2.dat) you can modify the file names to use another different matrixes.

MAKE SURE ALL FILES ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY!
