To compile this code try 
  
    cc server1.c -o server1     then,
    cc client1.c -o client1     
    
    
to run it use

    ./server1 &                 then,
    ./client1 + 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    
you can use '+', '-','*', and '/' as operator, for every different operator you will see an error message on console

NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO RUN THE SERVER1.C FILE FIRT

HAVE FUN !!!
