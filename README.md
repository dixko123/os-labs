LAB 1.7
For this Lab we worked in four different ways of ejecuting TASKS (First-Come First Served (FCFS),Shortest-Job-First (SJF),Priority Scheduling and Round-Robin Scheduling). For this lab I dind´t worked with strucutres to define a process, I used a method for each process. We can see each method inside the main and Run one by one, but not at the same time.

For each case the program will ask for the number of process

First-Come First Served (FCFS):
 for this case the program will ask for the time of each process. You will see on the screen how much time takes for the TASK ejecution, the response time and the total time for all the TASK ejecutions, also you will see the the order of how they were treated. For this case firs TASK readed will be the first on be treated.
 
Shortest-Job-First:
As the previos method, you will be asked for the number of process and the process time, in this case you will see on the screen how  the TASK were teated depending on the process time. This means the one with the less process time will be the one on the treated.

Priority Scheduling: 
Again you will be asked for the number of proceess and their priority, for this case I dind´t add and ejecution time. You will see only how the TASKS were treated depending on the priority.
